Heap

- Deletion in a heap (Max or Min) - Home Work

Steps:
1. Remove root element and update root element with last element
2. Then check your heap tree is heapify or not
3. To compare root node with left child(2 * i) and right child(2 * i + 1)
4. Recursively check at all nodes

Priority Queue:

- heap is one efficient implementation of an abstract data type is called priority queue.
- because in a heap highhest or lowest priority element is always stored at the root node.
- priority queue class is used to implement by default min heap
- To implement max heap, we use Collections.reverseOrder().

- Max Heap implementation by using priority queue - done
- Min Heap implementation by using priority queue - done

-Heap Sort - Home Work

- Inorder Successor in Binary Search Tree
- Inorder Predessor in Binary Search Tree

- Find Peak(max or min) Number in a Binary Tree - Home Work

Max Value:

result = node.data
lmax
rmax

lmax > result
result = lmax

rmax > result
result = rmax

Min Value:

result = node.data
lmin
rmin

lmin < result
result = lmin

rmax < result
result = rmin
